        <p>The Nintendo club was founded in 2022 and has been ongoing ever since! The founders of this club formed this club with the intent of it being a place where people can share and express their interests freely. Overall, we want to create a fun and safe environment for students who are interested in our club! Whether you come to talk to friends or play, everybody is welcome here! Feel free to join us after tenth period :D We will be holding much more events in the future so keep an eye out!</p>
